  <!-- SDG2 Statement -->
  <div class="sdg2-container">
    <p>Goal 2 is about creating a world free of hunger by 2030. The global issue of hunger and food insecurity has shown an alarming increase since 2015, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities.</p>

    <p>In 2024, an estimated 8.2 per cent – or 1 of 12 people – of the global population faced hunger and about 28 per cent – nearly 2.3 billion people – were moderately or severely food insecure. Global hunger levels, measured by the prevalence of undernourishment, remained at the same level for three consecutive years after a sharp rise during the pandemic. This data underscores the severity of the situation, revealing a growing crisis.</p>

    <p>In addition, an estimated 2.33 billion people faced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2023. This classification signifies their lack of access to sufficient nourishment. This number escalated by an alarming 383 million people compared to 2019.</p>

    <p>The persistent surge in hunger and food insecurity, fueled by a complex interplay of factors, demands immediate attention and coordinated global efforts to alleviate this critical humanitarian challenge.</p>

    <p>Extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods.</p>

    <p>2 billion people in the world do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. In 2024, 23.2 per cent of children had stunted growth and 6.6 per cent of children under the age of 5 were affected by wasting.</p>
